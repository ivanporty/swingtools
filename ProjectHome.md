Set of useful tools, components and examples from Russian Swing books author Ivan Portyankin, including:

  * dynamic forms and tables for fast prototyping and dynamic data editing and viewing
  * background tasks executors and support
  * extended tables with filters and advanced functions with no extra dependencies
  * simple animations and progress bars
  * multiple-selection drop-down with no custom ugly painting
  * pure MVC checkbox list with no custom ugly painting
  * full coverage with Swing FEST automated tests guarantee quality
  * minimally rely on 3rd party libs to better control size and functionality

The documentation and very detailed tutorial for all the tools and classes is effectively Ivan Portyankin's blog at http://www.ipsoftware.ru/blog.

Difference from SwingX or JIDE or other component libraries:

  * Almost no custom painting or components - mostly effective algorithms and techniques under the same widely used components like JXTree
  * Small, focused, driven off the blog and described problems
